# Specifying the network name makes it predictable on all environments,
# for example when running browser tests on a CI environment, or any other
# tasks which requires external docker containers to connect to our network.
# This network has been previously created in ./scripts/deploy.sh
# See https://github.com/docker/compose/issues/3736.
