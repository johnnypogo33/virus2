About
-----

This project is a quick starter for Node applications on Docker. We have implemented a very simple chat application with authentication (see "Resources", below) using Socket.io, Express, and MongoDB.

Strategies, credentials, and accounts
-----

This project uses [Passport](https://www.passportjs.org/) for authentication along with the "Username/password" strategy.

You can create a new account or regenerate a random password for an existing account by typing, on the command line:

    ./scripts/reset-password.sh some-username

Quickstart
-----

Install Docker and run:

    ./scripts/deploy.sh

This will give you a URL, username and password.

Now log on using the the credentials provided.

You will be able to use a simple chat application, and log out.

Creating new users
-----

You can run:

    ./scripts/reset-password.sh some-new-user
